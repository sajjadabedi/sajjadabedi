- 👋 Hi, I’m Sajjad
- 👀 I’m interested Design and solving nitty-gritty design problems.
- 🌱 In my spare time I enjoy tinkering with making software and website, like building apps and designing project that no one will ever use, ha ha. Making 3D stuff and tinkering with third-dimensional is fun, too.
- 💞️ Would love to disccuss design, accessiblity and design system.
- 📫 Send me a DM in Slack.
